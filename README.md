# BIKE-SHARING-DEMAND-PREDECTION

# INTRODUCTION

This is the problem related to the regression prediction where we have to predict continuous target variable that is rented bike sales using the different independent variables related to the atmospheric condition.

Here we will follow few norms for systemizing the approach to find the best prediction.

1) Data Exploration and analysing pattern of relation among different variables.

2) Removing outliers and dropping correlating variables.

3) Defining target variables and features variables.

4) Splitting the data for training and testing.

5) Choosing the different model like linear regression, random forest regression, polynomial regression.

6) Fitting the data and predicting result.

7) Evaluation of the result using different metrics like Mean Squared Error, R2_score etc.

8) Hyper Parameter Tuning using Lasso, Ridge, Grid Search CV.

9) Comparing different model with the help of metrics.

10) Analysing importance of different features in prediction (Model explainability).

11) Conclusion

# CONCLUSION

1) Most number of bikes rented in between 15 and 20 hrs which shows evening period sees higher demand.

2) Temperature having 20 to 30 degree celcius sees highest demand of rental bikes (Automn or Summer season).

3) Humidity with 40 to 70 % with maximum demand.

4) Lower wind speed increases the demand of Rental Bike.

5) Demand of rental bikes increased with higher visibility.

6) Higher dew point temperature with greater demand of Rental Bikes.

7) Demand decreases with higher Solar Radiations.

8) Demand decreases during higher Rainfall and Snowfall.
